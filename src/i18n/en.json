    "title": "Frequently Asked Questions",
    "before_title": "Before sampling",
    "after_title": "After sampling",
    "before": {
      "question1": "I have several prescriptions from different doctors, what should I do?",
      "answer1": "There is no problem, we will make a file for each prescription. Each doctor will have the results of the analyses they requested. We will bill them only once. It is completely transparent for you, everything happens at the secretariat. We will only sample you once.",
      "question2": "Can I be accompanied and lying down?",
      "answer2": "You can be accompanied as long as the companion does not disturb the proper performance of the sampling. If needed, all Zeroual group laboratories have sampling rooms with reclining chairs or beds for you to lie down. Just remember to inform us or ask us.",
      "question3": "Will I have to wait long?",
      "answer3": "All our teams do their best to minimize waiting. However, a minimum time is necessary to ensure maximum safety, for you as for us (identity information checks, care, blood sampling without haste, tube labeling...). Moreover, the number of samplers is in accordance with the expected attendance at the laboratory.",
      "question4": "Can I come at any time?",
      "answer4": "We welcome you 7/7 & 24/24. The detail must be checked with each laboratory in the <a href=\"/contact\">Find a laboratory</a> section. Blood tests can generally be performed without time constraints, respecting any fasting conditions. However, for certain analyses, sampling must respect time constraints: some parameters vary during the day. Contact your laboratory or on the <a href=\"#\">Prepare your analyses</a> section.",
      "question5": "Blood sampling and my medications",
      "answer5": "Before your blood test, you can take the medications prescribed to you. However, there is one exception: blood sampling must be performed BEFORE the usual intake of the treatment if your prescription specifies that it is a dosage of the medication itself. It will be important to inform your laboratory of any ongoing treatment, particularly those containing BIOTIN or vitamin B8 (QIZENDAY®, food supplements, etc.). If you have any doubt, ask your doctor and/or biologist for advice.",
      "question6": "I am a minor",
      "answer6": "A sampling on a minor cannot be performed without the presence of a responsible parent, or in the context of family planning, but always accompanied by an adult. The results will be transmitted to the prescribing physician or legal guardian.",
      "question7": "I would like to have an analysis, but I don't have a prescription",
      "answer7": "For a \"routine\" analysis (beta-HCG, glycemia, cholesterol, HIV…): there is no problem, we will perform the analysis you request. It will be billed according to its rating in the Medical Biology Nomenclature. For a more specific request, as long as the analysis is feasible in Morocco in an approved laboratory, we will offer you a quote. The analysis will be billed according to its rating in the Medical Biology Nomenclature or according to the Executing Laboratory's rating, increased by any transmission costs. In all cases, nothing will be performed without your agreement or validation of the announced price. For an analysis performed in a foreign laboratory or outside the care pathway, contact your Biologist.",
      "question8": "Do I need to make an appointment at the laboratory?",
      "answer8": "Zeroual laboratories welcome you all day without appointment. Some laboratories may offer appointments to facilitate your passage. For blood tests in children under 5 years old and bacteriological samplings, whatever the age, an appointment may sometimes be necessary. To see schedules or make an appointment, select your laboratory from the <a href=\"/rdv\">Find a laboratory</a> list.",
      "question9": "Which examinations require fasting?",
      "answer9": "The fasting state is necessary to obtain a blood specimen suitable for performing certain analyses. <strong>It is defined by an absence of food intake for 8 to 12 hours.</strong> <ul><li>CALCITONINE (Thyrocalcitonine): Stop PPI anti-ulcer treatment, Proton Pump Inhibitors for 15 days (omeprazole, esomeprazole, lanzoprazole, pentoprazole, rabeprazole).</li><li>CROSSLAPS – CTX</li><li>CRYOGLOBULINE</li><li>FASTING GLYCEMIA</li><li>HELIKIT: No tobacco from the evening before, stop PPI anti-ulcer treatment (Proton Pump Inhibitors for 15 days: omeprazole, esomeprazole, lanzoprazole, pentoprazole, rabeprazole).</li><li>HOMOCYSTEINE</li><li>PARATHORMONE – PTH</li><li>PHOSPHORUS</li><li>TESTOSTERONE</li><li>TRIGLYCERIDES – LIPID PROFILE</li></ul>",
      "question10": "I am a disabled person, how can I be welcomed?",
      "answer10": "All our laboratories offer a solution for our disabled patients. The laboratory's public accessibility register can be provided upon request. Do not hesitate to contact the laboratory to organize your sampling in the best conditions."
    },
    "after": {
      "question1": "I had a bruise after a sampling",
      "answer1": "If the vein does not close quickly enough or if the sampling was difficult, a bruise may appear. Our samplers do everything to avoid such inconveniences. The bruise comes from the accumulation of blood between the vein wall and the skin. It may look impressive but is never serious and disappears spontaneously. To minimize the appearance of these hematomas, it is recommended to apply pressure for several minutes after the blood test.",
      "question2": "When and how will I receive my results?",
      "answer2": "Classically, you will receive your results the same day, electronically, faster and more ecological, in the form of encrypted mail or by accessing the laboratory's secure result server. Some more specialized examinations may require additional time. You also have the possibility to come and collect your results at the laboratory. In this case, you must indicate it to the reception secretary, who will give you a coupon guaranteeing your confidentiality. The laboratory can also send you the results by postal mail with an extended delay of 2 to 3 days after file validation. Postal shipping costs of 2€ per result may be charged to you. In the event of worrying results or if they deem it necessary, the laboratory biologists may be led to contact your prescribing physician or an on-call physician or you directly by telephone.",
      "question3": "Can someone at the laboratory interpret my results for me?",
      "answer3": "Of course, Zeroual laboratories' biologists are available to answer all your questions and interpret your results in complete confidentiality. Ask at reception!",
      "question4": "What happens in case of major abnormality on a result?",
      "answer4": "Your prescribing physician is systematically informed in case of major abnormality on your result. If they cannot be reached, the laboratory will contact you to inform you and give you the directives to follow: make another appointment with your doctor, contact emergency services, go directly to emergencies…",
      "question5": "How to make a request for access to my medical file?",
      "answer5": "To access your medical file, you can fill in the following forms and transmit them by email or mail to your laboratory: <ul><li>Patient's medical file access form</li><li>Access form for a deceased patient's medical file by next of kin</li><li>Patient's opposition form to the communication of their medical file after their death</li></ul>",
      "question6": "How to report a non-conformity or make a complaint?",
      "answer6": "For any complaint or non-conformity report, we invite you to fill in the form on our dedicated space: <a href=\"#\">Submit a complaint &gt;…</a>",
      "question7": "I received my encrypted report, why?",
      "answer7": "The laboratory has sent you your examination report in the form of an encrypted PDF file attached to the notification email. To protect you, this encryption allows this medical document not to be directly readable or indexed on the Internet. Only the email recipient is able to associate the file received and the key (improperly called password) necessary for its opening. The Adobe technical solution does not allow the deletion or modification of the encryption key. The file therefore remains protected during its storage on your computer. In counterpart, it is not reusable or distributable to a third party, except by transmitting your personal encryption key to them at the same time. If you wish to keep unencrypted documents in your medical file, you must use the laboratory's result server. It allows you access to your entire medical file and gives you the possibility to download unprotected documents.",
      "question8": "What to do if I have lost the encryption key for my reports?",
      "answer8": "The laboratory has sent you your examination report in the form of an encrypted PDF file attached to the notification email. The PDF is not readable, except by knowing the decryption key. We invite you to contact the laboratory secretariat who can indicate the procedure to follow to find the key used at the time of sending your documents."
